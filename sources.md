## ChatGPT
chatgpt helped me make small changes to make code simpler and in some cases possibly more efficient

like this for loop in asm_cast_fireball
```go
for i, char := range direction {
    fmt.Printf("%v, %c\n", i, char)
}
```
just these lines, not the logic inside the for loop

also for quick questions about documentation and finding errors while learning go


q: how can i check if a value is in an array in go?

a: 

q:     if direction == "n" || direction == "nw" || direction == "ne" {
        return
    }

is there a more succint way to write this?
